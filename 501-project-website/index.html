        <p  style="font-size:12px;"> Hi, my name is Yilin Yang. Glad to see you all! I am a new graduate student in DSAN. I was in Syracuse University during my under-graduated studies. I have chosen information management & technology and applied mathematics as my under-graduated major. I am from Nanjing, China. My hometown is a peaceful and beautiful city. Nanjing contains many historic sites. It has been six capital city in six dynasties in China. In my hometown, there are a lot of delicious food. Nanjing is famous for making duck-style food. Many people say that No duck can live to go out from Nanjing. 
            I am so interested in the data analytics in the WE media field. In DSAN, I would like to focus more on data visualization, NLP. I have learned a little about data visualization. When do some work about data analytics, data visualization and gather a story about data make me feel a sense of achievement and I have more energy to focus myself to devote into work. 
            in my under-graduated studies, I am very interested in this field. In the future, I plan to be a data analyst in companies like Bytedance, Netflix. In the long run, I decide to create my own team to do data analysis for internet influencers to help them locate their fields, promote their contents in order to attract more audiences. Media and data science are all my interest fields, I would like to devote myself into these fields to make more contributions
            I have taken introduction to machine learning and introduction to data visualization, these courses help me to locate what I really interested in and I want to choose this field as my future job.
            I have two lovely cats, I love them so much! It is very enjoyable when I come home and see my cats waiting for me. They are friendly and cute. My friends all like them and bring a lot of food and toys to them. In my free time, I like staying with my cats, watching movies, and hanging out with my friends. I enjoy trying all kinds of food to feel different culture difference among different countries, having dinner with my friends and finding out fancy restaurants are very enjoyable moments to me. Traveling is a enjoyable moments to me. I have visited different countries and had a lot of fun. In last summer, I have been to Miami and really had a good time here. We went sky diving and many water sports. I really appreciate these exciting moments to let me fully release myself. 
            I also like pastries. Making desserts also helps me to feel comfortable and calm. I like all kinds of things for me to concentrate my self. I think this means I truly love these things. I enjoy sharing my desserts with my friends. In the future, if I have the chance to have a pastry of my own, I will be so glad and try my best to make my desserts popular. </p>
