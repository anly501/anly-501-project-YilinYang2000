                        <p class="mb-15">We-media (also called as self-media) is a platform on the Internet. It gives a user the facility to write article published videos which are possessing a very unique identity. On the basis of content format, we-media platform can be split into three types namely text, video- and audio-based. Besides the conventional we-media like blogs, other we-media platforms that are gaining prominence are live streaming platforms and self-made funny video platforms. </h4>
                            <p>With the popularity of video-clip, there is an increasing number of people to choose WE media to start  their own careers. The considerable income and low requirement which WE media brings attract people's attention. It gives people a nearly fair chance to get success in this field if they have some specific characteristics and have the ability to attract audiences. </p>
                            <p>In this topic, I want to discuss more about the future of the WE media. Can WE media still be popular in long run? Due to the popularity trend, more and more people choose to be an internet influencer, livestream sales, online learning consultants, etc. Due to the market saturation, can people still be success in this field? How they can do to be success? 
                                Monetization of WE media can be various. For example, ad sales can find internet influencers to promote their products in order to attract more costumers. Many companies can use their network, data background, promotion ability to build many internet influencers and make collaborations with them in order to earn money. All fans and number of clicks can be the monetization of this field. More than this, this field can also provide a nearly fair environment to everyone to become success. No matter what educational background, job experience, age, abilities, everyone can  have the chance to be success. </p>
                            <p>I stil want to discuss the pros and cons in WE media popularity. People nowadays enjoy the short and modified videos like ins story, tiktok. On the contrary of the huge economical benefit they brings to the society, do they affect people's privacy due to the data analysis? Seller use huge datasets to define what consumers will curious about in order to promote their products. At this time, Do consumers have the ability to protect their privacy? Furthermore, Do people have abilities to calm down to enjoy whole books and movies in the future?  Because of the wide range of the concepts of short video, do they have effects on tennagers' mental health</p>
                            <p>As a result, I would like to disscuss more about the relationship between data science and WE media. What factors do people in WE media have to be success. I also want to explore more about how internet influcers remain popular during the highly competition nowadays. I think this brand new field provide people more chances and curiosities.</p>

                        <p class="mb-15">Just use tik-tok as an example:</p>
                        <p class="mb-15">The mechanism of Tik-tok is "public domain traffic pool + precise algorithm". If a work wants to explode, the key lies in whether it is selected into the traffic pool for promotion, and whether it matches the algorithm requirements for continuous and stable output. The value of fans on Tik-Tok is very small, because Tik-tok users actually have no "right to choose". Compared with Zhihu, Official Accounts, Station B, Toutiao, Xiaohongshu, etc., users can choose themselves from the main page I like to watch things, but Tik-Tok doesn’t work. Tiktok's model is that the machine decides what and when you watch.</p>

                        <p class="mb-15">With the further maturity of the self-media industry, all links must continue to be pushed to the extreme, and behind the push to the extreme often means a more specialized division of labor, and some businesses that integrate specialized nodes can often increase in size. In this context, MCN was born. Recently, especially since 2017, this model has gradually become a trend in the domestic self-media ecosystem. Many traditional brokerage companies, Internet celebrity brokerages, and leading self-media have transformed into MCNs.MCN, spelled in English as Multi-Channel Network, began to appear on the video platform youtube outside the wall 5 to 6 years ago. The literal translation is a multi-channel network, that is, a video self-media that combines many PGCs (professional production content), which can be used in products and productions. , Organizations that provide assistance (to sub-channels) in areas such as funding, cross-promotion, partnership management, digital rights management, monetization/sales, audience development, etc. You can understand MCN as a new brokerage company serving self-media on youtube. In a narrow sense, MCN is generally in the field of short videos. The MCN referred to by Sajia in this article can be expanded to other types of self-media by yourself. Organizations integrated to play the role of brokers can be called MCNs, and self-media alliances can also be counted. Under the framework of MCN, the respective media are still relatively independent content producers; MCN’s profit model is mainly to rely on its own resources to sign contracts with self-media and get advertising revenue, generally at a 30-70 split; on the platform side, MCN is often more bargaining than general self-media Right to obtain more resource tilt.</p>
